# üöñ OLA Booking Analysis ‚Äì Data Analytics Project  

## üìå Project Overview  
This project is a **End-to-End** **real-world analytics case study** inspired by the ride-sharing industry. The goal was to analyze OLA booking data, identify key trends, understand customer/driver behavior, and create **interactive dashboards** for decision-making.  

The project covers the **end-to-end analytics workflow**:  
1. **Data Extraction & Cleaning (SQL)**  
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Excel)**  
3. **Visualization & Reporting (Power BI)**
