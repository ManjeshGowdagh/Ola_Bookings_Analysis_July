🚖 OLA Booking Analysis – Data Analytics Project
📌 Project Overview

This project is a real-world analytics case study inspired by the ride-sharing industry. The goal was to analyze OLA booking data, identify key trends, understand customer/driver behavior, and create interactive dashboards for decision-making.

The project covers the end-to-end analytics workflow:

Data Extraction & Cleaning (SQL)

Exploratory Data Analysis (Excel)

Visualization & Reporting (Power BI)

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

SQL → Data extraction, transformation, and preparation

Excel → Data analysis, pivot tables, summarization

Power BI → Interactive dashboards and reporting

📖 What I Learned

Writing SQL queries to clean, join, and aggregate booking datasets

Using Excel pivot tables & formulas for detailed analysis

Designing Power BI dashboards to visualize KPIs and tell a data story

Understanding the end-to-end analytics pipeline from raw data → insights → visualization

📊 Dashboards
1️⃣ Overall Dashboard

Insights:

Total 100,000 bookings analyzed in the period

Total booking value of ₹32.66M

Success Rate: 62% of rides

Ride volume shows fluctuations, with weekly peaks

2️⃣ Vehicle Type Dashboard

Insights:

Mini (₹9.07M) and Prime Plus (₹9.00M) had the highest total booking value

Auto (₹8.89M) and Bike (₹8.99M) also contributed significantly

Average ride distance across all vehicle types was ~18 km

Prime Sedan and Prime SUV generated lower revenues compared to shared/economical options

3️⃣ Revenue Dashboard

Insights:

Cash (₹15M) and UPI (₹10M) dominate payment methods (together ~75%)

Credit/Debit Cards contributed less to total revenue

Top 5 customers contributed ~₹5,000 collectively

Revenue trend remains consistent across the month with slight weekly variations

4️⃣ Cancellation Dashboard

Insights:

Total Bookings: 96,732 → with 24,991 cancellations (~26%)

Customer Cancellations: Major reasons include Driver asked to cancel and Change of plans

Driver Cancellations: Top reasons were Customer-related issues and More than permitted people

Key improvement area → reducing customer dissatisfaction & ensuring better driver availability

5️⃣ Ratings Dashboard

Insights:

Driver Ratings: Average around 4.0 – 4.01 across all vehicle types

Customer Ratings: Slightly lower (~3.99 – 4.01)

Ratings show consistency across different vehicle categories

✅ Results & Impact

Achieved 62% successful ride completion rate

Identified cancellation hotspots, enabling strategy changes that could reduce cancellations by ~10%

Clear revenue insights highlighting customer preference for cash/UPI payments

Built a professional Power BI dashboard for continuous monitoring of KPIs
